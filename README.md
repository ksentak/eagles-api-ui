# Eagles API UI

![Built with React](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-React-61dafb?labelColor=5b5b5b&style=flat)

Eagles API is a custom built user interface for an API that I created. The project was developed with React and Material UI. Users can make different API calls based on their input, and players from the Philadelphia Eagles roster will be displayed.

The API itself was created with NestJS and is deployed to an AWS Lambda using serverless.
